This is the repository for the paper "Automating Periodontal Bone Loss Measurement via Dental Landmark Localisation" 
which has been accepted for presentation and publication at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions (IPCAI) 2021 and published in the International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery (IJCARS).

The code is currently being refactored to improve its readability - unfortunately this has been delayed due to personal circumstances, however it is now being updated regularly.

Note that as this paper was majoritively written throughout 2020, online services, such as Google Collab and Google Drive, were used throughout the project, therefore the majority of scripts are in .ipynb format (these were converted to .py once the UCL HPC was used) and can be seen throughout some of the files.
