This is the repository for the paper "Automating Periodontal Bone Loss Measurement via Dental Landmark Localisation" 
which has been accepted for presentation and publication at the International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions (IPCAI) 2021 and published in the International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery (IJCARS).
The code is currently being refactored to improve its readability and it is aimed to be available in July - this is delayed as the corresponding author no longer in academia full-time.
